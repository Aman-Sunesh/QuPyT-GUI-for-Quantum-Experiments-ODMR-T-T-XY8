# Auto-generated ODMR experiment configuration by the QuPyt GUI upon pressing “Start”
# Defines experiment_type, sensor, synchroniser, device settings, data parameters, and pulse_sequence
# This file is overwritten on each run; adjust settings via the GUI rather than editing directly
# Similar yaml files will be created for other experiments like XY8
