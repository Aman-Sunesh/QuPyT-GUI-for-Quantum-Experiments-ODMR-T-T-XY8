# This script provides a utility function to safely stop any running PulseBlaster
# pulse sequence. It is typically called when the user presses the "Stop" button
# in the GUI or if the program needs to abort an experiment. It ensures the device
# is halted, reset, and properly closed to prevent hardware lock-ups.
